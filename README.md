# nba-database
In this project, a practical Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) was designed and implemented for the statistics and records of NBA players. We first designed the relational model with UML diagram, then encoded it as SQL schemes. With JDBC API, we connected the database system with our user program. To carry out the review and modification functionality, a front-end GUI was developed based on HTML/CSS/JSP. With Spring/Spring MVC frameworks, each front-end operation was mapped into a controller-layer method, which connected with database by calling service-layer and DAO-layer methods. Several SQL queries were developed for Select, Insert, Update and Delete of game records. All the programming works were based on MySQL and Java EE web service.
